This Python script is designed for network analysis using depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS) algorithms. It interacts with a network graph provided by a remote server and performs operations such as displaying the network, showing connections, and establishing new connections between vertices.

## Features

1. **DFS Analysis**: The script performs a DFS traversal on the graph, printing each vertex's name in the order visited. Additionally, it identifies and reports if the graph contains cycles.

2. **BFS Analysis**: The BFS algorithm is applied to explore the network from a specified source. It prints the vertices in each level of the BFS traversal.

3. **Network Connectivity**: You can connect two people in the graph using the "connect" command. The script then updates the adjacency map and reports the successful connection.

4. **Show Network Statistics**: The script displays the number of vertices visited during DFS analysis.

5. **Show Connections of a Person**: You can check the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd connections of a person in the network using the "show_connections" command.
